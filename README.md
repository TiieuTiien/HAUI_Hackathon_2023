Multiple People Tracking and Gender/Age Recoginition Challenge. <br>
About the competition: [HAUI Hackathon 2023](https://haui-ai-hackathon.ntq.ai/)

# Introduction
Multiple object tracking is one of the most basic and most important tasks in computer vision. It is one of the fundamental research topics in understanding visual content. It has numerous applications in indoor navigation, motion capture, human computer interaction, robotics etc.

The multi-person tracking and gender/age recognition competition aims to challenge participants to develop innovative solutions for accurately tracking and recognizing multiple individuals in real-world scenarios, while also accurately identifying their gender and age.

Participants will be provided with a large dataset of videos or images that capture diverse scenarios and demographics, including crowded public spaces, events, and other settings where multiple people are present. They will be asked to develop algorithms that can accurately track individuals across frames, while also recognizing their gender and estimating their age range based on visual cues.

# Data Format and Training Data
For the training data, the participants will need to find the training data and submit it to the organizers before Phase 1 starts. 

# Testing Data
In the first phase, the testing data will be 10 videos that the organizer crawled from 2-3 cameras in Japan. Each video has 30 seconds. 

In the second phase, the testing data will be more than 40 videos that the organizer crawled from 2-3 cameras in Japan. Each video has 30 seconds. 

# Phase Description
Phase 1 (9/9/2023-3/11/2023): To spread information to the HAUI students,thereby helping the students have time to access problem solving directions. At the same time, during this time, the teams will have access to real data, model training and model evaluation through an automatic evaluation system. The maximum number of submissions is 10 times in 1 day.

Phase 2 (3/11/2023-14/12/2023): The organizers will evaluate the teams with good results in the Phase 1 to choose to enter the Phase 2 round. In this phase, the teams will submit the final results using the pre-trained model in the Phase 1t phase. The maximum number of submissions is 5 times in 1 day. The time to publish the data and open the data will be announced later.
